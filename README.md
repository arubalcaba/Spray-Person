# SprayPersonApp

Yet another amazing AngularJS app

## Getting Started

Front end requires Bower, which requires bower

### Install NPM:
But this is an SBT app?!?  For the front end dependency management you will need npm.

Options
- https://www.npmjs.org/doc/README.html
- `brew install npm`

### Install bower
Bower is a front end dependency manager `npm install -g bower`

Download all the front end dependencies with `bower install`

### Install Grunt CLI
Grunt is a front end task runner
`npm install -g grunt-cli`

Wire up the dependencies with `grunt bowerInstall`


## Documentation

### Running the Spray-Person
Start sbt with `sbt`

Start the container with `~container:start` (the ~ tells sbt to reload when any files change)
